                    I used Python libraries Pandas to read my csv file I have downloaded from kaggle and to clean if I have null values . 
                    I then used KMeans algorithm to group customers who may require credit and categorize them based on their credit needs.
                    Model performance is evaluated after train_test_split method to divide my dataset .
                     I later used accuracy_score metrics to check my training and testing accuracy where i got 100% on
                      training and 96% on testing . I visualized using confusion matrix. The model can be used in 
                      real-time credit predictions and to be able to do decision-making if the customer is worthy of the 
                      credit or not . With that we have less than 5% of making mistakes. </p>

                        The process began by obtaining a dataset from Kaggle and utilizing Python, along with the Pandas
                         library, to clean the data by removing unnecessary columns. Numerical values were mapped to 1
                          if above the median and 0 otherwise, while research on Google helped identify factors
                           influencing car pricing for handling categorical variables. 
                        The main goal was to predict car prices, which were mapped based on their median. This enables 
                        informing customers if their desired car's price is above or below the median, accounting for 
                        variations in car prices over time and across locations. 
                        The dataset was then split using the train_test_split function, with 20% allocated for testing. 
                        The model's accuracy was evaluated, resulting in a 87.88 score. 
                        To gain insights and aid in decision-making, the data and model results were visualized using
                         Classification view with Matplotlib and Seaborn. The model was deployed on GitHub, making it
                          ready for car price predictions and assisting potential car buyers. </p>

                        <b>Salary Prediction</b> 
                       <p id="edu">June 2023 <br>
                    Solely</p> 
In this project, I, as a Data Scientist, built a Salary Prediction Model using Linear Regression.
 I used a dataset from Kaggle and prepared it for analysis by organizing the data. The dataset was split 
 into training and testing sets to ensure the model's accuracy on new data. I employed scikit-learn's
  LinearRegression to train the model and understand the relationships between factors and salaries. 
The model's performance was evaluated using the R-squared (R2) score, indicating a high accuracy of 97%
 on the training data and 89% on the testing data. To visually represent the model's accuracy, I created
  a scatter plot comparing actual salaries with predicted values, adding a line to illustrate the
   alignment between predictions and real salaries. 
In conclusion, my Salary Prediction Model using Linear Regression demonstrated its reliability and 
precision in estimating salaries. The thorough data preprocessing, evaluation, and visualizations made 
it a valuable tool for real-world salary estimations.

                       <b>Movie Analysis</b>

In this project, I analyzed a movie dataset using Python's data manipulation and visualization tools.
 I aimed to uncover trends in movie preferences over time. I used libraries like pandas to clean and
  preprocess the data and matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations. I examined average movie 
  ratings, streaming platform popularity, and the relationship between movie age and viewer interest.
   The analysis revealed how platforms in movie distribution. Understanding these insights allows me to 
   make informed recommendations and predictions for the movie industry's future. This project has been a 
   rewarding journey into data analysis and visualization with Python</p>
