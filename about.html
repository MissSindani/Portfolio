 <h3>Personal Story</h3>
<p>I'm a 20 year old who have been passionate about writing since grade 4. I started writing my thoughts and stories 
    when they started introducing essay writing to us.
     I'm excited to share my journey with you and continue exploring new horizons together.</p>
<h3>Professional Background</h3> 
<p>Despite my young age, I've already made significant strides in my field.Before completing my matric, 
I had the privilege of publishing with two companies. These early experiences provided me with invaluable insights into the world of
 writing and strengthened my commitment 
to pursuing a being passionate.</p>
 <h3>Passion and Interests</h3> 
<p>In my free time, you'll often find me discovering something new , cooking or baking.
     These activities not only provide a welcome balance to my work but also serve as a
     wellspring of inspiration for my writing and creativity. I believe
    that a diverse set of interests enriches both my personal and professional life,
     and I'm always eager to explore new avenues of curiosity.</p>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>I'm a Christian, and my faith is really important to me. One special thing I do because of my faith is going to church every Sunday.
     It's a way for me to connect with my church community,think about my spiritual journey, and get closer to God.My favorite bible
      verse is <b>Isaiah 60 verse 22</b> <i> "When The Time Is Right I, The Lord Will Make It Happen"</i> </p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>In school, I had a unique way of building confidence. I became known for my public speaking especially when
     we had evemts, which I not only wrote but also memorized by heart. I didn't stop there; I took part in school poetry competitions and
 performed with enthusiasm. These experiences not only helped me gain confidence but also ignited my passion for self-expression through words.</p>
